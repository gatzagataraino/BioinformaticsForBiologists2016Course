The Grade I Deserve is...

I always find it hard to write such descriptions.
Based on your recommendations, I think I should write "The grade I deserve is an 8" :-)
Because:

- I added a profile picture of me diving in the Caribbean while sampling algae. 
I will use git and GitHub to have version control of the scripts I will write to make phylogenetic trees of my algae samples.
So that is a nice link.

- I added a cool picture of fish to my README.md file cheer you up (in case you like fish)
I used this command:  echo '![fish_picture](Fish_in_Croatia.jpg)' >> README.md
I also learned that I cannot use this command to add a picture to a .txt file

- I learned how to create a repository, clone this to my local computer, make changes, add the modified documents to the staged 
documents, commit them (including a message that describes what I changed) and push it back to the cloud. 
I added a document with instructions on how to create a repository to my repository TestGitHub.
I also added a document with useful git commands.
I tried adding a powerpoint file (called Onno_Luna_Presentation_2) to see how that would look. You cannot view the slide
online, but it is possible to download the powerpoint.
When I added a pdf file, I was able to view it online.

- I learned the difference between collaborating in a repository (having full rights) and forking the repository to my
local computer, modify files, and then sending a pull request to the owner of the files to see if he/she wants to merge my
changes with his/her files. I also tested both ways.
I became a collaborator of richelbilderbeek/BioinformaticsForBiologists2016Course by sending an issue.
I added a file to this repository 
(and I switched off notifications by email to avoid spam).
I merged documents with LJK1991/Bioinformatics-Course.
I gave him my cool fish picture and a code to add pictures to the README.md file

- I follow people and other people follow me.

- I had a merge conflict (within my own repository) and fixed this.

- I created another GitHub repository for my project for this course:
https://github.com/LunavdL/Project_concatenating_trees
I work together with Onno den Boon. He became a collaborator.
I also added a document with the requirements for the project.

- I asked a lot of questions.

Thanks for the help today!

p.s. sorry that there are no screenshots...but I have not managed to make a screenshot yet in linux (every program makes a screenshot, but then it is just a black picture instead of a picture of the screen)
