the grade I think i deserve is 8.5. I worked mostly on the receptory “Friday”. In the Friday receptory you can find a report with some screenshots in case you want to check.

Apart from the usual things as change my profile and the things you proposed, I explored a bit more and created an organization and a team inside it. I also started creating a wiki and added some links in the text. In the following lines you can see a summarize of what I did.

-Create a repository, clone it modify push and pull
-create a repository with a license and a .gitignore (this receptory is called "things")
-Create a pull request
-Collaborate and get data that is been removed back
-Change profile and follow other people and star a project
-Issue on a project I am not collaborating
-Fork a receptory I am not collaborating
-Create a repository in an organization
-Create a team in an organization and invite new members
-Create a wiki with two pages and a link between the pages (as in real Wikipedia)
-Create a to do list in the issues
-Create a depository with a license and .gitignore
-Close issue
